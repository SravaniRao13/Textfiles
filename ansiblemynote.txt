1. first we need to create a role or play.
    ansible-galaxy init rolename
2. in role we automatically get a tree structure such as defaults, files,handlers, meta, Readme.md, tasks,templates,tests,vars.
    variabilized in either defaults or vars.
     in tasks we will have main.yml
     in tests we will have inventory file, test.yml
     in test.yml we write hosts:windows/localhost(default).
     in etc we have vi hosts. we give ip address. for total server pinging.
3.execution in 2 ways.
  ansible-playbook -i inventory playbookname.yml
                                or
  if we already gave hostname like windows or localhost then we use this command
   ansible-playbook playbookname/tests/test.yml.
